.TH VIEW-OS 1 "August 18, 2007" "VIEW-OS: a process with a view"
.SH NAME
kmview \- Kernel Mode implementation of View-OS
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B kmview 
[
.I options
]
.I prog
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The main goal of the View-OS project is to give each process its own view
of the system resources.
For example, each process can mount filesystems or hide some file or
directories. It is also possible to assign virtual network interfaces, IP
addresses or define virtual devices for each process (or for hierarchies of
processes).
.br
.B kmview 
is the kernel mode implementation of View-OS concepts.
It works on a linux kernel providing utrace and it needs the 
.B kmview 
kernel module already loaded to work.
It is a modular partial virtual machine. 
.B umview 
before loading any module is completely transparent, a process
behaves inside 
.B umview
as it would have behaved outside.
Each module can customize specific entities: there are modules to mount
filesystems at user-level
.B (umfuse)
, to define virtual network interfaces
.B (lwipv6)
, to define virtual devices
.B (umdev)
, to provide interpreters for executables, e.g. to support executables for
foreign architectures
.B (umbinfmt)
, to hide, move, overlay parts of the file system
.B (viewfs).
.br
These are some examples of modules provided by the View-OS team. 
.B umview
aims to provide a general interface to customize the system call semantics
of process under specified conditions. So more modules will be added both
by the View-OS team and by third parties.
.SH OPTIONS
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-V\fP \fIname\fP" 4
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-viewname\fP \fIname\fP" 4
set the name of the view. The view can be read and set using 
.B vuname
or
.B viewname
commands.
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-p\fP \fImodule\fP [ , \fImodule_options\fP ]" 4 
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-preload\fR \fImodule\fP [ , \fImodule_options\fP ]" 4
preload modules. 
Modules will be loaded as shared libraries thus all the
rules to load libraries apply. Modules must be loaded from a directory
within the ld.so search path or should be specified by their pathnames. 
If necessary
configure the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable appropriately.
\fImodule_options\fR are module specific configuration options, thus the reader
should refer to each service module manual for a complete description.
Modules can be loaded at run time using the
.B um_add_service
command.
.IP "\fB\-x\fP" 4 
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-nonesting\fR" 4
.B umview
is able to provide module nesting, i.e. a module can provide services on
the basis of virtual services provided by another module or even by the
module itself. For example it is possible to mount a file system image
which is stored in an already virtually mounted filesystem.
This feature requires the pure_libc library. 
The \fB\-x\fR or \fB\-\-nonesting\fR option disables the nesting feature.
.IP "\fB\-o\fP \fIfile\fP" 4 
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-output\fR \fIfile\fP" 4
This option diverts the debugging output to the file specified, it is
useful when
.B umview
has been compiled with debugging extensions.
.IP "\fB\-v\fP" 4 
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-version\fR" 4
Print the version and exit.
.IP "\fB\-h\fP" 4 
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-help\fR" 4
Print a short help message and exit.
