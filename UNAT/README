uNAT - userspace (universal) NAT
================================

uNAT is a proof-of-concept userspace NAT/ daemon for IPv4/IPv6 traffic. It can
manage IP traffic from virtual networks (e.g. it can be used with UserModeLinux or KVM) 
and from real networks (it can send and receive IP packets from physical interfaces).
