pure_libc is not complete.

scanf has not been implemented.

Multi-threading support has been designed but the calls are already dummy
stubs. (The main probkem is to be vanilla glibc consistent).

... a lot of secondary calls are still missing.
those tightly linked to the syscall routines in glibs must be reimplemented,
all the others are already diverted to pure_libc.
