	  <h1>lwIPv6 - A Hybrid V4/V6 Lightweight TCP/IP Stack </h1>
	  <p>
	    The web page you are watching was served by a simple web
	    server running on top of the hybrid lightweight TCP/IP stack 
	    lwIPv6.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    lwIP is an open source implementation of the TCP/IP
	    protocol suite that was originally written by Adam Dunkels
	    of the Swedish Institute of Computer Science but now is
	    being actively developed by a team of developers
	    distributed world-wide. Since it's release, lwIP has
	    spurred a lot of interest and has been ported to several
	    platforms and operating systems. lwIP can be used either
	    with or without an underlying OS.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The focus of the lwIP TCP/IP implementation is to reduce
	    the RAM usage while still having a full scale TCP. This
	    makes lwIP suitable for use in embedded systems with tens
	    of kilobytes of free RAM and room for around 40 kilobytes
	    of code ROM.

			LWIPv6 is the evolution of the LWIP project developed at
			the Department of Computer Science University of Bologna (Italy) 
			by Renzo Davoli (rd235) and his team.
			LWIPv6 is an hybrid stack working both for IPv4 and IPv6.
			This is not a dual stack: there is one single IPv6 stack,
			incoming IPv4 packets are converted into IPv6 compatible packet first,
			outgoing packets are converted into V4 just before leaving the stack
			when addressed to IPv4 destinations.
	  </p>
		<p>
			This stack is part of the <a href="http://www.virtualsquare.org/">
			Virtual Square</a> project. LWIPv6 is also loadable as a module
			of <a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/view-os"> View-OS </a>.
