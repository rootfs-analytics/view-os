Fuse-ext2 has been forked again.
The latest development (for linux only) is in the dir ../fuse-umfuse-ext2

May 13 2012

The development of ext2/3/4 support for umfuse has been merged in the
project named fuse-ext2:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/fuse-ext2/

If you download and compile the source code of fuse-ext2 on a system
where view-os support is already installed, you'll get also the 
umfuseext2 module.
