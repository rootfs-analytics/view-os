This is fuse-ext2 (http://sourceforge.net/projects/fuse-ext2/)

The former fuseext2 (without dash) that was here has been in
favor of fuse-ext2.

Alper Akcan <alper.akcan@gmail.com> and Renzo Davoli <renzo@cs.unibo.it>
worked together in August 2009 to merge their projects.

This svn is a just temporary solution for a smooth conversion of Debian
packets.

The official source repository is:
