This is kmview: the kernel module view-os implementation.

More precisely this directory includes the kernel patches and the 
kernel module source code.

Please note that kmview is already an experimental project.

To install kmview:

1- download your favourite kernel (>=2.6.29) Check into kernel_patches that we
have already updated the kernel patches for that kernel.

2- download and install the latest utrace patches for the kernel you
downloaded (from http://www.redhat.com/~roland/utrace)

3- make menuconfig, check the options, compile the kernel.

4- type:
make
in this directory (if the new kernel has already been installed), otherwise
type:
make KERNELDIR="/path/to/your/kernel_source/"

5- boot the kernel, run
# insmod kmview

6- create the device:
# mkdev /dev/kmview c 10 233
# chmod 666 /dev/kmview

Now you can run the kmview application and enjoy the fast virtualization.

(for older kernel download old versions from the svn).
