This is kmview: the kernel module view-os implementation.

More precisely this directory includes the kernel patches and the 
kernel module source code.

Please note that kmview is already an experimental project.

To install kmview:

1- download your favourite kernel (>2.6.22) Check into kernel_patches that we
have already updated the kerenl patches for that kernel.

2- download and install the latest utrace patches for the kernel you
downloaded (from http://www.redhat.com/~roland/utrace)

3- download and install from the directory "kernel_patches" here the 
.callorder patch compatible with your kernel.

4 (optional) download and install also the ptmulti patch (it is not needed
		for runninng kmview, it provides extensions to ptrace: this patch speeds 
		up umview.)

5- make menuconfig, check the options, compile the kernel.

6- type:
make
in this directory (if the new kernel has already been installed), otherwise
type:
make KERNELDIR="/path/to/your/kernel_source/"

7- boot the kernel, run
# insmod kmview

8- create the device:
# mkdev /dev/kmview c 10 233
# chmod 666 /dev/kmview
(official device number assignment requested).

Now you can run the kmview application and enjoy the fast virtualization.
