.TH VIEW-OS 1 "July 22, 2009" "VIEW-OS: a process with a view"
.SH NAME
viewmount \- mount command for view-os (umview, kmview)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B viewmount 
[-hr]
[-t
.I vfstype
]
[-o
.I options
]
.I device
.I dir
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
This command has the same meaning and and a reduced set of features of 
.B mount(8).
View-OS previously used the standard mount command from linux-utils-ng.
Since v.2.15.rc1 mount is not compatible any more with View-OS for
an unnecessary restriction when the executable is not setuid.
We hope the developers of linux-utils-ng can fix the problem asap.
