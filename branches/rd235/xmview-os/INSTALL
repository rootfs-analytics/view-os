If you obtained UMView from the CVS repository you need the following
software:

- autoconf 2.60
- automake 1.10

In order to create the configure script and related files you can use the
following command:

$ autoreconf -i

After that, or if you obtained UMView from the official tarballs, the usual
autotools command apply:

$ ./configure && make && make install

You can add `--enable-debug' as an option to configure if you need verbose
debug reporting in UMView.
