The patches here included add the PTRACE_MULTI tag to the
ptrace system call into the linux kernel of the hosting machine.

This patch add PTRACE MULTI for the following architectures:
i386 ppc um (subarch i386)

UMVIEW does not need any patch in the kernel of the hosting computer to 
work but with PTRACE_MULTI there is a dramatic increase in performance.

(Tech detail: standard ptrace needs one system call invocation for
each word of memory to be tranferred between the process memory
and the umview memory. System calls like read/write need one context
switch each 4 bytes - on 32bits machine. With PTRACE_MULTI one single
system call invocation suffices).

PT_VM is a more advanced patch.
It is a more efficient support of PTRACE for Virtual Machine.
with PT_VM it is possible to use the PTRACE_SYSVM call instead
of PTRACE_SYSCALL. PTRACE_SYSVM has a parameter that can be set to skip
the syscall execution and/or the after-syscall trace upcall.
