EncFS code is already fully umfuse compatible.
In fact EncFS uses private_data instead of global variables to
keep the file system state (as should be required by fuse interface)

The source code can be downloaded from encfs project site:
http://code.google.com/p/encfs/

This directory include just a patch to encfs/Makefile.am which
adds the generation of umfuseencfs to the automake process.

HOWTO:

- get a source code tree
e.g.:
$ svn checkout http://encfs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ encfs-read-only
or
$ wget http://encfs.googlecode.com/files/encfs-?????.tgz
$ tar zxvf encfs.?????
(change ????? with the current version of encfs)

- enter the root dir of the source tree
$ cd encfs-read-only
or 
$ cd encfs.?????

- apply the patch
$ patch -p 1 < /dir/of/the/patch/viewos.encfs.patch

- start the whole automake preocedure
$ autoreconf -i
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

that's it

April, 30 2010 (renzo)

Temporary note: (Apr. 30 2010) as to today's encfs version there is an
incompatibility with libboost-serialization 1.42. 
It works if linked against v. 1.40 or earlier.
It is not a problem of viewos/umfuse, the behavior is the same when running
fuse-encfs and umfuse-encfs.
