    * Renzo Davoli <renzo@cs.unibo.it> created a very useful patch for 
    fusecram to read cramfs images in foreign bytesex. It allow read
    images with little-endian byteorder on big-endian machines and vice versa.

    * Critical bug found -- there is some situations when compressed 
    block size is bigger than PAGE_CACHE_SIZE because compression not always
    sufficient. For now internal buffers set to PAGE_CACHE_SIZE * 2 for 
    compressed blocks.
