/dev/kmview is 10.233 as defined in the Kernel source tree.
In Documentation/devices.txt (since 2.6.30):
...
 10 char  Non-serial mice, misc features
     233 = /dev/kmview View-OS A process with a view

Somebody erroneously assigned the same number to vhost_net device, thus
the two features are incompatible as thay share the same device id.

In include/linux/miscdevice.h:
#define VHOST_NET_MINOR   233

We hope that this bug will be fixed as soon as possible.
